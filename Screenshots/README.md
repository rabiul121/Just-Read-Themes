This folder is intended to hold screenshots and short GIFs demonstrating themes and the Summarizer flow.

Suggested screenshots and GIFs to add here:

- `theme-eng-dark-arial.png` — preview of the English Arial dark theme.
- `theme-bn-light-kalpurush.png` — preview of a Bengali light theme (Kalpurush).
- `summarizer-flow.gif` — short GIF showing: open article → Just Read → Summarize → result.

How to create them (Windows)

1. Use the built-in Snipping Tool for static screenshots (Win+Shift+S).
2. For GIFs, use a lightweight recorder like ShareX or ScreenToGif and crop the recording area to the Just Read panel.
3. Export GIFs at 10–12 FPS and keep them short (3–6 seconds) so they load quickly in the README.

Where to place files

Place image files directly in this `Screenshots/` folder and reference them from the README with relative paths, for example:

`![dark theme preview](Screenshots/theme-eng-dark-arial.png)`

License and privacy

Only include screenshots of web pages where you have permission to share the content, or use placeholder/sample text pages.
